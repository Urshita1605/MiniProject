# ------------------------------------
# 🚀 Terraform Files
# ------------------------------------
# .terraform/ is the local directory where Terraform stores downloaded provider 
# plugins and modules. It should not be committed to Git.
.terraform/

# Terraform state files - these track the real-world infrastructure's state.
# They are managed via a remote backend (like S3 or a dedicated service) and 
# should NEVER be committed to Git directly, especially in a team environment.
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
# The image shows 'terraform.tfstate' and 'terraform.tfstate.backup' within 
# the 'backend' folder, so we must exclude them relative to the root:
backend/*.tfstate
backend/*.tfstate.*

# Crash log files from Terraform
crash.log
log/

# History of inputs from 'terraform console'
.terraform.console.history

# Files that contain sensitive variables (though it's better to use 
# environment variables or dedicated secret managers)
# *.auto.tfvars

# ------------------------------------
# 💻 IDE/Editor Files (VS Code)
# ------------------------------------
# VS Code creates a .vscode folder for workspace-specific settings, 
# tasks, and launch configurations.
.vscode/

# ------------------------------------
# 🔑 Credentials and Inventory
# ------------------------------------
# While 'aws_host' and 'ansible.cfg' might be needed for deployment, 
# if 'aws_host' contains sensitive information (like credentials or specific IPs 
# that are *not* dynamically provisioned and should be secret), you should 
# exclude it. For this example, we assume they are *not* sensitive. 
# If they contain credentials, UNCOMMENT the lines below:
# ansible.cfg
# aws_host

# 📦 OS/General Temporary Files
# ------------------------------------
# macOS files
.DS_Store

# Windows thumbnail database
Thumbs.db
